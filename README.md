# Project Overview

- Having dealt with a fundamental HTML structure encompassing elements like a header, footer, main content area, and news items, we undertook the task of writing CSS for a responsive webpage layout. In the context of our web development endeavors, responsive design played a pivotal role, guaranteeing that web content not only appeared visually appealing but also remained functional across many devices which include: desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
